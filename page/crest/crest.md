Semi-empirical methods are often employed to explore and efficiently sample the conformational space of molecules.
The Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST) uses the GFN methods to generate ensembles and find low-energy structures.
Besides conformational search algorithms, CREST provides a variety of workflows.

For more information about CREST, check out the [docs](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/).
