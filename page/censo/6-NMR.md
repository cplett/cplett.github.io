Important application of computational methods is supporting the analysis of experimental spectra. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most frequently used methods for structure elucidation or evaluation of reaction products in an experimental setting. Often, the molecules of interest are flexible organic molecules. Therefore, in order to reproduce experimental NMR spectra it can be paramount to use an ensemble approach for the calculation of the spectrum, because of the dependence of chemical shifts and, even more so, coupling constants on the molecular geometry. L-Histidine is a natural product that shows this behavior. Your task going forward is to
calculate the NMR parameters of L-Histidine using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensebmle Sampling Tool (CREST) and Command-line Energetic Sorting of Conformer-Rotamer Ensembles (CENSO) programs to first generate an ensemble and then calculate the 1H-NMR parameters.

{% include important.html content='This task requires some time to compute, approximately 2.5h on 4 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1270 v5 @ 3.60GHz, not the fastest). Most of the time will be taken up by geometry optimizations, so if you expect this to take too long, consider skipping the geometry optimization step in CENSO (set run = False in the **optimization**-section in censo2rc histidine)'%}

##  Ensemble Refinement and Spectral Parameter Calculation
{% include important.html content='For the next steps, the ORCA software is required.'%}

Next, you are going to refine the ensemble using DFT calculations.
CREST uses GFN2-xTB as the default method, which produces ensemble rankings that are not accurate enough for NMR calculations.
Therefore, it is necessary to refine the initial ensemble.
You can do this using CENSO, which is supposed to automate the process of ensemble refinement and property calculation.
**Before starting your calculations, please configure the program paths in the provided configuration file.**
You can define the number of cores for CENSO with **--maxcores**.

CENSO will write output for all parts in text-format, as well as in json-format (`.out` and `.json` files). 
You will also find ensembles in xyz-format, as well as all files generated using the run in your working directory, sorted by section.
\\
In the printout of the program and in the `4_NMR.out` file you will find the ensemble--averaged NMR parameters.
Sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate (DSS) is used as the NMR standard, and the spectrum is recorded at a frequency of 600 MHz in aqueous solution.
Compare the ensemble--averaged values and the values for the lowest conformer only to the provided experimental reference values below.
